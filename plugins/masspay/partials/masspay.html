    <div class="col-md-12">With this plugin you can create, sign, broadcast and verify multiple payments in one single operation. If your computer crashes or this application was shutdown during a payments operation upon startup you'll be able to pick up where you left off. After all payments were broadcasted you'll be able to confirm that each transaction is actually in the blockchain. Once all payments succeeded and all are in the blockchain you'll be notified of it's success.<br><br>In order to determine if transactions are in the blockchain we calculate the transaction fullHash client side. Since the broadcastTransaction API call cannot always return reliable transaction status we are forced to rely on transaction fullHash instead of simply using the transaction id.<br><br>Payments are entered through a JSON file, two syntaxes are supported the dense and verbose syntax. If you are sending payments to accounts without publickey please use the publish format (account and public key separated by a : symbol).

          <div>We have calculated the transaction fullHash for each of your payments and the API servers have confirmed that a transaction with that same fullHash is in fact in the blockchain. Mofowallet already is connected to multiple public nodes at the same time, mofowallet also scans these public nodes for forks. However before you can be absolutely sure your payments are still in the blockchain even after a waiting period you'll have to wait for at least some blocks. Luckily the mass pay plugin helps you with this, simply don't load another payments file and when you come back to this page you'll see the mass pay plugin remembered all payments in this session. Now click the Force Check button and mofowallet will tell you if your payments are still in the blockchain.</div>
